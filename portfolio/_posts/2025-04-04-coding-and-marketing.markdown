### Tutorial for Vitis AI using the Sign Language MNIST
[Github Repo](https://github.com/beetleboxorg/sign_language_mnist)
A tutorial to demonstrate how to leverage BeetleboxCI and Vitis AI to deploy a sign langauge recognition model on FPGAs.

This is a tutorial designed to show how to get started using BeetleboxCI and Vitis AI, in which we cover the following:

- Designing a Neural Network - Designing a simple neural network in Tensorflow and Keras.
- Training a Neural Network - We will show how this neural network can be trained through BeetleboxCI.
- Converting the model and preparing for FPGAs - Through BeetleboxCI we will also be converting the model for use on FPGAs as well as creating the files to run on the board.

### Getting Started with BeetleboxCI and Raspberry Pis
[Github Repo](https://github.com/beetleboxorg/getting-started-raspberry-pi-ci-cd)

This tutorial provides a quick and easy way for users to set up CI/CD for Raspberry Pi using BeetleboxCI, aiming for a setup time of under 30 minutes.

### Embedded CI/CD Tutorial for STM32 Microcontrollers

[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lYf7Z_Cd90)

This is an example of a video tutorial we would create for our customers. This is a embedded CI/CD Tutorial for STM32 Microcontrollers. We  created a on-demand webinar on unlocking how to automate STM32 microcontroller development. This one covered:

- The physical and software architecture needed for embedded DevOps.
- Building pipelines targeting STM32 microcontrollers.
- Using the STM32Cube software ecosystem for compilation and programming.
- Running directly on STM32 Nucleo development boards.

### AI on FPGAs Explained

This educational video exemplified the kind of content I helped create to explain complex technical concepts to a broader audience.

### Beetlebox Code and Documentation

All documentation was written between myself and Marlon Wijeyasinghe. I handled the majority of the tutorials and would use them when providing technical tutorials for our customers.
