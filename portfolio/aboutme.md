title: About me
subtitle: Founder | Software and Hardware Engineer | Technical Sales and Marketing
---

I'm a founding engineer with a proven track record in taking full-stack solutions from concept to market, encompassing technical sales, marketing, engineering management, DevOps, embedded systems, and FPGAs. My work in these areas has resulted in a patent and a publication. My core passion lies in building and scaling impactful technolgies.

I founded Beetlebox, a UK-based startup focused on revolutionizing embedded systems testing. Our automated platform, BeetleboxCI, provided developers with cutting-edge tools to streamline their testing processes and minimize errors.

BeetleboxCI offered powerful device farm and hardware-in-the-loop testing capabilities, enabling the simultaneous execution of thousands of tests across hundreds of devices. This reduced reliance on expensive and time-consuming tessts. Prior to BeetleboxCI, we also performed pioneering work on Computer Vision for FPGAs and hardware-based compilers.
